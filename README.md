To annoy and keep a log of people when they log out of OSRS
 
Checks a list of people every hour for any xp difference from the offical OSRS highscores. 
If there is an xp difference they are pinged in discord and the date + total xp + name is saved in a json file creating an accurate log of xp gains.
